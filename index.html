                <p>IND VS WI 3rd ODI</p>
<P><strong>Prediction<br></strong>West Indies is most likely to retain the same team as they did in the last two games. They have been effective and have managed to bring the fight in the ODI series. Both Hetmyer and Hope have been brilliant so far and will look to continue their form. West Indies’ bowling needs to improve and skipper Jason Holder might make a change in their bowling department in Pune.

India who only announced their team for the first two ODIs will now try to rotate the squad as much as possible before the crucial cricket season kicks off in Australia next month. Although the team management would have liked to go two-nil ahead in the series, they would be pretty happy with the performance of the team so far. The new squad might not have a lot of changes and are expected to retain almost all of the players currently in the squad.</P>
                <hr>
                <P><strong>Expect to Win<br></strong>Although West Indies brought the game down to the wire, they would be disappointed that they couldn’t beat India on Wednesday. They will have another go in Mumbai and will be going all guns blazing in the third ODI. India on the other hand will take an unassailable lead if they manage to win in Mumbai. With three games remaining, India will not lose the series if they win the third ODI and will be focused to get the job done. Our money is on the in-form Virat Kohli and his men to win it in Pune</P>
